Why didnâ€™t the no_segfault_ex program segfault?
- The program did not segfault because the program is not trying to acces memory that it not available to it. The forloop will increment out of the range of int(a) 
Why does the no_segfault_ex produce inconsistent outputs?
- Because the sizeof is greater than 5, the total will keep be added outside of the array continue down the memory address.
Why is sizeof incorrect? How could you still use sizeof but make the code correct?
- The size of is incorrect because it returns 20. Because the array is of type int, and each int holds 4 bytes in memory, five of them will then be 20 bytes. You can divide sizeof(a) by 5 to make it right.
